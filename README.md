# Raspi-Watch

Raspi-Watch is a tool to monitor your raspberry pi when running headless. Its an easy to build, low-cost project. 
Its also great when you want to start with GPIO programming on raspberry pi or you just want to switch from python to c++.
For me, it was also the entry of GPIO programming. I'm doing c++ programming for years, but this was my first time programming with 
a raspberry pi.
